    <br>I made some questions and answers
    <br>And when an user's answer is correct or incorrect,
    <br>It will show the user correct or incorrect message
    <br>And finally it will calculate the grade of the test.</p>

    <p>I'm working on making secure section of a website that I made
    <br>by using MongoDB. If the user is authenticated,
    <br>he will be taken to a list View that I make. 
    <br>otherwise, he will be redirected back to the Login View.
    <br>And if the user attempts to access the secure area of the site, 
    <br>they should be redirected back to the Login View</p>
